# Datasets: Guide

Store your local datasets in this folder (`.csv`, `.xlsx`, `.json`, `.sqlite`, ...). You can use the README to document each dataset (where it's from, what data & types it contains, what you use it for, ...).

One of the primary goals of this repository is that anyone can clone and replicate your research. To make this possible **DO NOT modify or overwrite your raw datasets**! You should keep them _exactly_ as they were when you downloaded them, you may even want to name them `dataset.raw.ext` (eg. `daily_temperatures.raw.csv`).

When cleaning and processing your datasets, you should save the prepared data to a _new_ file with a descriptive name. This approach will result in many dataset files, but that's ok!
