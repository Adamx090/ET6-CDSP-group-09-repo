## Summary

During this meeting, we conducted a brainstorming session to explore and define
potential domains based on our personal interests, experiences, and background
research.

## Key Points Discussed

- A collaborative brainstorming session was held to generate domain ideas.  
- All domain suggestions were documented in a shared Google Doc.  
- Team members were encouraged to contribute freely and openly before narrowing
down the focus areas.  
- It was agreed that each member would select one or more domains that personally
interest them.  
- Everyone will explore the chosen domain(s) further, conduct a brief literature
review, and begin thinking about possible research questions.

## Next Steps

By the next meeting on **June 9**, each participant will:  

- Continue exploring their selected domain(s)  
- Conduct background research and a literature review  
- Propose research questions based on their exploration
