# Collaboration

## Group Norms

### 💠 Our Shared Purpose

We want our group to be a space where everyone feels respected, safe, and
encouraged to grow. We believe in working together honestly, listening with
care, and staying open to different ideas. Our aim is to build trust, do our
best, and support each other as a team.

### 🗣️ Communication & Respect

• We speak with kindness and listen with full attention.  
• Every voice matters — all ideas are treated with respect; we focus on
what is said, not who says it.  
• We ask questions freely and express our views without fear of judgment.  
• Disagreements are natural; we focus on resolving issues, not blaming
people.  
• Open dialogue is encouraged — curiosity and understanding come before
conclusions.

### 🔍 Constructive Discussions & Debate

• We define clear goals before a discussion or debate begins.  
• All opinions are welcome — even those different from our own.  
• Debates are not competitions; they are opportunities to explore together.  
• If we reach a standstill, we’ll vote or turn to a neutral member for
guidance.  
• We stay respectful, positive, and growth-minded throughout.  
• We engage in debates with a respectful and positive attitude, focusing on
ideas rather than individuals, and striving for constructive outcomes.  
• When reviewing code or project content, we focus on the work itself — not
on the person who wrote it.  
• Feedback should be constructive, respectful, and aimed at improving the
outcome.  

### 🤝 Trust & Team Connection

• We start from a place of trust — everyone is here to contribute and grow.  
• Mistakes are part of learning; we respond with support, not judgment.  
• If trust is broken, we commit to resolving it openly and respectfully.  
• Sharing personal moments, stories, or humor strengthens our connection.  
• We each take responsibility for our roles and reach out for help when
needed.  

### 🕒 Time & Responsibility

• We respect each other’s time by being punctual and prepared.  
• Meetings will be planned collaboratively, choosing times that work best
for most.  
• Deadlines are important, but transparency and collaboration come first.  
• We value steady contribution over constant presence.  
• Share workload fairly and adjust regularly using check-ins and project
boards.

### 🔁 Flexibility & Growth

• Plans may change, and that’s okay — we adjust together.  
• Feedback is a gift — we use it to improve, not to criticize.  
• We embrace learning at every stage and encourage each other’s
development.  
• We’ll revisit and update these norms as needed to reflect how we’re
evolving.  

### ✅ Our Commitments as a Team

• Create a kind and inclusive space.  
• Speak honestly, listen actively.  
• Stay open to diverse ideas.  
• Respect time and communicate clearly.  
• Support one another in challenges.  
• Take shared responsibility for our work.  
• Make decisions fairly, with everyone’s voice heard.  
• Keep improving how we work together.  
• Celebrate each other’s efforts and grow as a team.
