# Retrospective

## Stop Doing

- Assuming everyone is on the same page without confirming understanding
- Over-relying on chat-only communication without regular syncs
- Delaying introductions or icebreakers

## Continue Doing

- Respecting cultural and time zone differences
- Using GitHub and Slack effectively for collaboration and documentation
- Holding regular stand-ups or check-ins to align as a team

## Start Doing

- Creating a shared team agreement or collaboration charter
- Scheduling time for informal bonding
- Assigning rotating roles (e.g., timekeeper, note-taker) during meetings

## Lessons Learned

- Communication is key â€” over-communication is better than under-communication
- Being proactive and open-minded improves group cohesion
- Cross-cultural collaboration is a learning experience that requires patience
- Even without heavy technical work, setting clear expectations early
can save time and stress

## Strategy vs. Board

### What parts of your plan went as expected?

### What parts of your plan did not work out?

### Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?

### Or remove extra steps?

## Individual Retrospectives

### Hussaini Ahmed

This milestone introduced me to the dynamics of collaborating with an
international and cross-cultural team. I learned that clear, respectful
communication is just as valuable as technical expertise.
One challenge I encountered was aligning meeting schedules with teammates
in different time zones. However, by being flexible and using
asynchronous updates effectively, we were able to stay on track.
