# ⚠️ Project Constraints

Project constraints define the boundaries and conditions under which the
 project must operate. They include external, internal involuntary,
and internal voluntary constraints that impact planning, execution, and collaboration.

---

## 🔗 External Constraints

Constraints outside the team’s direct control but must be accounted for in planning.

### ⏳ Deadlines

- Final and milestone deadlines are fixed and must be met without exception.  
- Include time buffers for reviews, integration, and unforeseen delays.

### 🌐 Unpredictable Disruptions

- Issues like internet outages, hardware failures, or power cuts may disrupt work.

### 💾 Mandatory Use of GitHub

- All code, documents, and deliverables must be stored and
versioned on GitHub.  
- No offline-only work is permitted.  
- GitHub is the single source of truth; all members must have access.

### 📊 Data Access Constraints

- Use of public datasets may involve licensing or usage restrictions.  
- Teams must verify data permissions before use.

## 🔐 Internal (Involuntary) Constraints

Constraints that arise from within the team but are not intentional — often
related to availability or limitations.

### 🧠 Skill Gaps

- Team members may have varying levels of experience.

### 🕰️ Time Limitations

- Some team members may have other responsibilities (e.g., work, family).  
- Project plans should accommodate limited availability.

### 🚨 Unexpected Interruptions

- Illness, emergencies, or personal events may impact participation.  
- Members should promptly notify the team to enable task redistribution.

## 🧭 Internal (Voluntary) Constraints

Team-agreed practices that support project quality, collaboration, and learning.

### 🙋 Task Preference

- Members can express task preferences based on interest or goals.  
- Flexibility is encouraged to support cross-learning with peer help.

### 📝 Documentation Standards

- All code must include comments and major components should have docstrings.  
Include usage examples, maintain a data dictionary, and document models.

### ✅ Review Checklist

- All work must be reviewed before merging into the main branch.  
- A shared checklist ensures code quality and encourages helpful feedback.

---

## 🔁 GitHub & Version Control Constraints

- Code must be regularly committed to GitHub.  
- Use feature branches for separate tasks or features.  
- Pull requests (PRs) are mandatory for merges.  
- Branch names must be descriptive and relevant to the task/problem.
