# Retrospective

## Stop Doing

- Assuming everyone is on the same page without confirming understanding  
- Over-relying on chat-only communication without regular syncs  
- Delaying introductions or icebreakers  

## Continue Doing

- Respecting cultural and time zone differences  
- Using GitHub and Slack effectively for collaboration and documentation  
- Holding regular stand-ups or check-ins to stay aligned as a team  

## Start Doing

- Creating a shared team agreement or collaboration charter  
- Scheduling time for informal bonding  
- Assigning rotating roles (e.g., timekeeper, note-taker) during meetings  

## Lessons Learned

- Communication is key ‚Äî over-communication is better than under-communication  
- Being proactive and open-minded improves group cohesion  
- Cross-cultural collaboration is a learning experience that requires patience  
- Even without heavy technical work, setting clear expectations early can save
time and stress

## Strategy vs. Board

### What parts of your plan went as expected?  

- Team members introduced themselves and quickly agreed on a regular
meeting schedule.  
- Early task delegation helped build momentum and provided clear
direction.  
- Most meetings and conversations were efficient and focused on our shared
goals.  
- Collaboration platforms (Slack and WhatsApp) were set up early, making
communication smooth.  

### What parts of your plan did not work out?  

- We initially underestimated how much time coordination would take across
different time zones and schedules.  

### Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?  

- We introduced WhatsApp as an additional communication channel to enable quicker
more informal check-ins and updates.  

### Or remove extra steps?  

- No major steps were removed. The first milestone proceeded smoothly without
requiring any significant adjustments.

This milestone introduced me to the dynamics of collaborating with an
international and cross-cultural team. I learned that clear, respectful
communication is just as valuable as technical expertise.  
One challenge I encountered was aligning meeting schedules with teammates in
different time zones. However, by being flexible and using asynchronous updates
effectively, we were able to stay on track.
