# Global Urban Pollution Profiles & Their Respiratory, Cardiovascular Health Impacts

## 1. Air Pollution as a Global Health Crisis

Air pollution is one of the most pressing global public health threats.
According to the WHO and the Global Burden of Disease (GBD 2024) study, ambient
air pollution causes approximately 7 million premature deaths annually. These
deaths are largely due to cardiovascular disease (CVD), respiratory illnesses,
stroke, lung cancer, and other noncommunicable diseases (WHO, 2023; GBD, 2024).

## 2. Major Pollutants and Their Health Pathways

Air pollution comprises various pollutants, each with distinct physical and chemical
properties, affecting health differently.

- **PM2.5**: Fine particles under 2.5μm in diameter. Chronic exposure raises risks
of stroke, heart attacks, lung cancer, and early death
(Pope & Dockery, 2006; WHO, 2021).  

- **NO₂**: Produced by vehicles and industry. It’s a known trigger for childhood
asthma (HEI, 2020).  

- **O₃**: A photochemical pollutant linked to reduced lung function and COPD flare-ups
(EPA, 2022).  

- **CO**: Results from incomplete combustion, reducing oxygen delivery. Especially
harmful to pregnant women and infants.  

| Pollutant | Health Effects                       | High-Risk Groups           |
|-----------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| PM2.5     | CVD, stroke, lung cancer             | Elderly, general population|
| NO₂       | Asthma onset, lung inflammation      | Children, urban residents  |
| O₃        | Lung irritation, lower lung function | Asthmatics, outdoor workers|
| CO        | Oxygen deprivation, neuro damage     | Pregnant women, infants    |

These pollutant-health links are backed by toxicological and epidemiological research
(Brook et al., 2010; GBD, 2024).

## 3. Why Focus on the Dominant Pollutant?

AQI systems (e.g., EPA, WAQI) define the dominant pollutant as the one with the
highest sub-index at a given moment.

Determining the dominant pollutant matters because it:

- Identifies the most hazardous exposure at that time.  
- Highlights the key contributor to health risk.  
- Guides city-level policy for targeted pollution control.  

By profiling cities using dominant pollutants, we reveal exposure-specific
burdens and regional health disparities.

## 4. Regional Signatures and Pollution Sources

Pollution varies by geography and season:

- **South Asia (Delhi, Lahore)**: PM2.5 spikes in winter from biomass burning,
- heating, traffic.  

- **Western Europe (Paris, Madrid)**: O₃ surges on hot summer days.  

- **Africa (Lagos, Nairobi)**: NO₂ rising due to diesel and urban growth.  

Local conditions demand tailored air quality responses—blanket policies may fail.

## 5. The Pollutant Composition Index (PCI)

PCI measures pollution distribution across pollutants.

- **Low PCI**: One dominant pollutant (e.g., 90% PM2.5).  
- **High PCI**: Mix of pollutants, requiring broader strategies.  

This index aids both source attribution and intervention design.

## 6. Beyond Exposure: Integrating Health Burden Data

We connect pollution data with GBD/WHO health metrics like:

- **Years of Life Lost (YLL)**  
- **Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs)**  
- **Cause-specific mortality rates**  

This integration reveals which pollutants most affect respiratory and cardiovascular
health.

### Example Comparative Analysis

- **Delhi, India**: PM2.5-dominant. High ischemic heart disease and chronic
respiratory DALYs (GBD, 2024).

- **Paris, France**: O₃-dominant in summer. Seasonal asthma and bronchitis
hospitalizations (WHO, 2023).

- **Lagos, Nigeria**: NO₂ rise due to traffic. Increased childhood asthma and
workforce absenteeism.

### Example Datasets and Maps

- **OpenAQ**: Real-time air quality data.  
- **WAQI**: AQI maps with pollutant breakdowns.  
- **GBD Compare**: Visualizes burden by disease and risk.  
- **NASA MODIS & Sentinel-5P**: Satellite pollution maps.  

## 7. Analytical Value and Research Gap

Most studies isolate either pollution or health data. This project integrates:

- Dominant pollutant classification,  
- Regional pollution patterns,  
- Pollutant-specific health effects,  
- City-wise health outcome differences.

It fills a key gap in global pollution-health analysis.

policy interventions.](Figure1.png)

### Outcomes

This approach enables:

- Smarter, pollutant-specific policies,  
- Health system readiness in high-burden zones,  
- Academic insights into pollution-health links.
