## 1. Domain: Global Air Pollution

Global air pollution remains a pressing environmental and health crisis,
responsible for around 7 million premature deaths annually and driven by
pollutants such as PM2.5, NO₂, O₃, and CO. This dataset enables city-level
analysis of air quality, allowing researchers to identify pollution hotspots,
compare regions, investigate pollutant-AQI correlations, and build predictive
models to support targeted interventions and policy-making.

### Research Questions

- Which cities had the highest and lowest AQI levels globally in 2024?
- What is the dominant pollutant (PM2.5, NO₂, CO, or O₃) in the top 10 most
  polluted cities?
- Can AQI be accurately predicted using pollutant concentrations with machine
  learning models?
- What are the geographical patterns of air quality across continents in 2024?
- Which pollutant contributes most significantly to poor air quality in
  different climate regions?

## 2. Domain: Renewable Energy

The global shift to renewable energy is essential for reducing emissions and
addressing climate change, with solar and wind energy expected to nearly triple
in capacity by 2030. Data science and AI techniques like forecasting and
clustering are helping optimize this transition by analyzing historical trends,
predicting future growth, and identifying regional patterns. Using these
datasets, researchers can explore energy trends from 1990–2020, compare
country-level progress, and forecast the future of clean energy adoption.

### Research Question

- How has global renewable energy (solar, wind, hydro, bioenergy) consumption
  evolved from 1990 to 2020?
- Which countries have shown the fastest and slowest growth in renewable energy
  adoption since 1990?
- What is the relationship between renewable energy growth and reductions in
  CO₂ emissions?
