# Domain Suggestion

## 1. Domain: inflation

Inflation, the sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services
in an economy over time, remains one of the most critical and complex indicators
of economic stability and performance. As both a macroeconomic phenomenon and a
household-level concern, inflation has far-reaching implications, affecting
purchasing power, interest rates, employment, business investment, and government
fiscal policy

Research Questions Examples:

What is the relationship between interest-based loan volumes and inflation rates
across countries from 2000 to 2022?
How has the relationship between interest-based lending and inflation changed
before and after the 2008 global financial crisis?

## 2. Domain: Birthrate Decline

In recent decades, many countries around the world have experienced a steady
decline in birthrates, raising concerns about long-term economic stability,
population aging, and labor force sustainability. This demographic shift is
particularly pronounced in high-income and rapidly developing nations, where
fertility rates have fallen below the replacement level of 2.1 births per woman.
Factors contributing to this trend include increased urbanization, higher
educational attainment, delayed marriage, economic uncertainty, and changing
social norms around family and gender roles.

Research Questions Examples:

Can female labor force participation and average marriage age predict birthrate
decline in OECD countries?
How do fertility trends differ between urban and rural regions in East Asia, and
what factors explain the gap?
