## 🌞 Domain: Solar Energy in Socioeconomic Context

🎯 Research Question (Possible):
How do cost factors and socioeconomic development influence the adoption of solar
energy in developed vs. developing countries?

📊 Key Data Factors & Sources

1. Installed Solar Energy Capacity (MW)
What it tells us: Annual solar installation capacity by country.
Source: IRENA Renewable Capacity Statistics
2. Access to Electricity (% of Population)
What it tells us: Percentage of the population with electricity access in each country.
Source: World Bank – Electricity Access Indicator
3. GDP per Capita (US$)
What it tells us: Average income per person — helps distinguish between developed
and developing countries.
Source: World Bank – GDP per Capita
🧹 Data Preparation Notes
Each dataset focuses on a single topic.
To explore relationships, we must:
Match data by country and year
Merge into one master file
Clean inconsistencies (e.g., mismatched country names, missing data)
⚠️ We may need to search for additional factors (e.g., solar radiation, policy
incentives, installation costs).
✅ Pros
Easy to access and clean (CSV available from IRENA & World Bank)
Standardized global data with broad temporal and geographic coverage
Enables socioeconomic comparisons (developed vs. developing countries)
Aligns with sustainability and energy justice themes (e.g., UN SDGs)
Suitable for correlation and trend analysis
Feasible within project timeline
⚠️ Cons
Shows correlation, not causation
Limited to country-level data (no regional or household granularity)
Still requires data cleaning
May lack key context (e.g., government policies, sunlight availability,
installation cost)
