# Domain Suggestion

## Domain: Global Warming / Climate Change

Global warming refers to the rise in Earth’s average temperature due to
greenhouse gas emissions, while climate change includes broader shifts like
extreme weather and sea-level rise. The last decade was the warmest on record,
and data shows increasing temperature trends and climate-related disasters.
Using datasets and tools like ARIMA, clustering, and regression, researchers
analyze patterns, forecast future warming, and compare regional impacts to guide
climate resilience efforts.
Research Questions:

How have global mean temperatures evolved year by year over the past century?
What is the correlation between atmospheric CO₂ levels and global temperature anomalies?
Which countries have experienced the fastest rate of warming between 1900 and
2024?
