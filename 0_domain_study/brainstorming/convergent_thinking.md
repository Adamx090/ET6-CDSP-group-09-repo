This file focuses on how we narrowed down our ideas and chose our research direction.

After the first poll, we actually had a tie between **Global Air Pollution**
and **Birthrate Declining**. The tiebreaker went in favor
**Global Air Pollution**, so thatâ€™s the domain we decided to focus on.

To see the full discussion and decisions we made during this process
until we settled on a question, check out
our GitHub thread here:
