# ðŸ”‘ Key Terms

A short glossary of the key terms used in this project, with both simple
and scientific definitions.

---

- **Air Pollution**  
  *Simple:* Harmful substances in the air that can affect our health and the
  environment.  
  *Scientific:* A mixture of solid particles and gases in the atmosphere,
  including pollutants like particulate matter, ozone, carbon monoxide,
  and nitrogen oxides.

- **Air Quality Index (AQI)**  
  *Simple:* A score that shows how clean or polluted the air is in a given
  location.  
  *Scientific:* A composite index that standardizes concentrations of major
  pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NOâ‚‚, Oâ‚ƒ, CO, SOâ‚‚) into a single scale to
  communicate health risk.

- **PM2.5 (Fine Particulate Matter)**  
  *Simple:* Tiny particles that can enter the lungs and bloodstream,
  causing health issues.  
  *Scientific:* Particles with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less;
  can penetrate alveolar regions of the lungs and are linked to
  cardiovascular and respiratory diseases.

- **NOâ‚‚ (Nitrogen Dioxide)**  
  *Simple:* A gas from car exhaust and factories that can make
  breathing problems worse.  
  *Scientific:* A reactive nitrogen oxide formed during combustion;
  contributes to the formation of ground-level ozone and can inflame airways.

- **Oâ‚ƒ (Ground-Level Ozone)**  
  *Simple:* A gas that forms in sunlight and can make it harder to breathe.  
  *Scientific:* A secondary pollutant produced by photochemical reactions
  between NOâ‚“ and volatile organic compounds (VOCs); known to impair lung function.

- **CO (Carbon Monoxide)**  
  *Simple:* A gas from burning fuels that can reduce the oxygen in your blood.  
  *Scientific:* A colorless, odorless gas from incomplete
  combustion; binds to hemoglobin with higher affinity than oxygen,
  reducing oxygen delivery to tissues.

- **Dominant Pollutant**  
  *Simple:* The pollutant that causes the most harm in a city or
  is most responsible for the AQI score.  
  *Scientific:* The pollutant with the highest contribution to
  air quality deterioration or health risk, often used to classify a
  cityâ€™s pollution profile.

- **Health Outcomes**  
  *Simple:* The illnesses or conditions people develop from breathing polluted
  air.  
  *Scientific:* Measurable effects of pollution exposure, including
  incidence rates of cardiovascular (e.g., stroke, heart disease)
  and respiratory (e.g., asthma, COPD) diseases.

- **Pollution Profile**  
  *Simple:* A way to group cities by which pollutant affects them most.  
  *Scientific:* A classification scheme based on dominant pollutant types
  and their typical sources, helping to compare urban health risks across regions.
