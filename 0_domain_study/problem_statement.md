# Problem Statement

One of our group members shared a personal story:

> Her mother, who has asthma, experiences severe discomfort when staying in
cities with poor air quality. Even short visits can mean weeks of relying on
medications, constant coughing, and the simple wish to breathe without pain.
For her and millions with similar and different health conditions, clean air
isn’t just a preference—it’s a necessity. But how feasible is it to find
cities where the air is truly safe for vulnerable individuals?

This personal story reflects a broader public health challenge. Air pollution is
one of the leading environmental threats to human health, contributing to an
estimated 7 million premature deaths annually due to its links with cardiovascular
and respiratory diseases, stroke, and lung cancer (WHO, 2023; GBD, 2024).
Yet widely used metrics like the Air Quality Index (AQI) often mask
the specific health risks posed by individual pollutants,
which vary across cities and regions.

This project seeks to answer the following research question:

> **How do respiratory and cardiovascular health outcomes in 2024 vary across
global cities categorized by their dominant air pollutant?**

This study introduces a novel framework that classifies global cities according
to their dominant pollutants and examines how these pollution profiles
correspond to regional patterns in respiratory and cardiovascular health outcomes.

The aim is to fill this gap by identifying dominant pollutant profiles worldwide
and analyzing how these align with regional health burdens, thereby informing
more targeted and pollutant-specific policy interventions.
